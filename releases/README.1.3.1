This release has a number of new components that are better suited for 
an Enterprise style use.  The Admin feature has been beefed up, a percentage 
completion has been added.  In order to support multiple users for the 
same project the percentage complete is stored by individual and  not by
project. An Overview feature to allow for the viewing of projects assigned
to users and/or what projects a user is assigned the 'Project Overview' tab.  
This new tab is supported by three means of saving; Printing, comma 
delimited file and plain old ASCII text.

During the redesigning phase of this some of the columns and tables were
altered.  If you are running version 1.1 or 1.2 you will need to execute
the following SQL statements on your database. **If you are not using MYSQL
then you will want to alter the SQL statements that support these tables.

Conversion from 1.2 to 1.3

alter table USERPROJECTS  add (COMPLETEDPCT INTEGER DEFAULT 0);
alter table USERPROJECTS  add (PROJECTHOURS INTEGER DEFAULT 0);

The rest of the changes are done thru the software itself and will easily
accommodate the new database changes without altering a users preferences
or their settings.  One note that might want to be taken into consideration is 
the updating of the hours spent from PROJECTS to USERPROJECTS.  This will
more accurately reflect any hours listed in that column.

New Features:
Some minor bug fixes and the overview tab.  Nothing else.

Coming in Release 1.2.3:
Saving of user data when they are no longer assigned to a project. Presently
if this happens any hours or percentage completed is removed.

A streaming exception, output log that can be viewed.  Right now if the database
connect fails on initialization no exception is noted.  This is tops on the list
to be corrected.

New Install:
This program is developed under the rule of -keep it simple-
All of the SQL statements are external of the application
so that different TO_DATE/DATETIME/DATE_FORMAT commands can
be massaged and used on any database.  It would be nice if 
we could get a standard, accepted, DATE manipulation command.

PRIOR to using. A database will need to be established. Once
that is done, open ./conf/config.xml and put in the goodies
for the <database> xml section.
Here are a few examples for different databases:
MySql:
          <driver>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:mysql://DBServer/titrationDB</url>
Oracle:
          <driver>oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:oracle:thin:@DBServer:1521:titrationDB</url>
HSQLDB:
          <driver>org.hsql.jdbcDriver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:HypersonicSQL:hsql://DBServer</url>
SQLServer:
          <driver>com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://DBServer:1433;DatabaseName=titrationDB</url>
          
There are two ways for Titration to find the appropriate library (jar file).
	1) Put it in the classpath prior to running
	2) Simply drop it in the $TITRATION_HOME/lib folder. The application
	   has a built in classloader that will find any .jar or .zip files
	
******************** IMPORTANT ********************
Once you have this done run the command: java -jar titration.jar -initdb
This will build your database.  If you're going to be using any high-
performance database you can go into ./conf/initdb.sql and change all
of your VARCHAR to VARCHAR2.  
***************************************************

**Please take note MYSQL is CASE SENSITIVE so if you change some of the tables
make sure you update them in ./conf/config.xml. 

Once you have this done you can simply double click the jar or run java -jar titration.jar

Building the project:
I have written the code so it's compatible with 1.4.2 or greater JDK (it -might- run on 
any platform).  The JBuilder project is included in the source release as well as a
standard ant script.  If your running windows make sure you use ant -f windows.build.xml
for build.xml is a sysV (Linux) directory structure release.
The ant file is designed to base all paths of the ROOT.DIR property. Simply change that
and you will be good to go.
