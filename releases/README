This program is developed under the rule of -keep it simple-
All of the SQL statements are external of the application
so that different TO_DATE/DATETIME/DATE_FORMAT commads can
be massaged and used on any database.  It would be nice if 
we could get a standard, accepted, DATE manipulation command.

PRIOR to using. A database will need to be established. Once
that is done, open ./conf/config.xml and put in the goodies
for the <database> xml section.
Here are a few examples for differant databases:
MySql:
          <driver>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:mysql://DBServer/titrationDB</url>
Oracle:
          <driver>oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:oracle:thin:@DBServer:1521:titrationDB</url>
HSQLDB:
          <driver>org.hsql.jdbcDriver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:HypersonicSQL:hsql://DBServer</url>
SQLServer:
          <driver>com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver</driver>
          <url>jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://DBServer:1433;DatabaseName=titrationDB</url>
          
There are two ways for Titration to find the appropriate library (jar file).
	1) Put it in the classpath prior to running
	2) Simply drop it in the $TITRATION_HOME/lib folder. The application
	   has a built in classloader that will find any .jar or .zip files
	   
Once you have this done run the command: java -jar titration.jar -initdb
This will build your database.  If you're going to be using any high-
performance database you can go into ./conf/initdb.sql and change all
of your VARCHAR to VARCHAR2.  

**Please take note MYSQL is CASE SENSITIVE so if you change some of the tables
make sure you update them in ./conf/config.xml. 

Once you have this done you can simply double click the jar or run java -jar titration.jar

Building the project:
I have written the code so it's compatable with 1.4.2 or greater JDK (it -might- run on 
any platform).  The JBuilder project is included in the source release as well as a
standard ant script.  If your running windows make sure you use ant -f windows.build.xml
for build.xml is a sysV (Linux) directory structure release.
The ant file is designed to base all paths of the ROOT.DIR property. Simply change that
and you will be good to go.
